# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Learning from labeled data to make predictions.

**Examples:**
- Classification (spam detection)
- Regression (price prediction)

### Unsupervised Learning
Finding patterns in unlabeled data.

**Examples:**
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks.

### Basic Architecture

1. **Input Layer** - Receives input data
2. **Hidden Layers** - Process information
3. **Output Layer** - Produces prediction

## Model Evaluation

### Classification Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

### Regression Metrics
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score
